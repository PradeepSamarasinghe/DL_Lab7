# Reinforcement Learning

## üìå Introduction
This repository contains the first lab for the Deep Learning ‚Äì Reinforcement Learning module. The focus is on implementing and comparing two key approaches in reinforcement learning:

Model-Based (Markov Decision Process: Policy Iteration / Value Iteration)

Model-Free (Q-Learning with GridWorld)

The lab helps develop practical coding skills, understand convergence behavior, and analyze execution time differences between these methods.

## üìù Tasks
### Question 1: Markov Decision Process & Q-Learning
Upload and run the Policy Iteration and GridWorld Q-Learning notebooks.

Complete missing code sections.

Experiment with larger grid sizes and observe performance changes.

Insert screenshots of completed code and results.

### Question 2: Model-Based vs Model-Free RL
Modify MDP notebook to compare execution time and convergence with Q-Learning.

Explain differences between both approaches.

Provide screenshots of results.

## üìä Results
Successful implementation of Policy Iteration and Q-Learning.

Performance comparison between Model-Based and Model-Free approaches.

Observations on scalability with larger grid sizes.
